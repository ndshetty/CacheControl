# CacheController


Created a Cache Controller using VHDL on the Spartan-3E FPGA Board. 
The objective of this project was to implement a block responsible for copying code or data from main memory to cache memory automatically. It implemented static RAM (SRAM) and synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) components as well as other custom logic controllers and memory units. 
The project was tested using the ChipScope Pro Tool by verifying the waveforms.
